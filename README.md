# Shopify Fall 2021 Front-end Internship Challenge

The Shoppies is Shopify's annual movie award. Each person can nominate for 5 movies. The movies are taken from OMDB. The 5 movies have to be unique. 

Additional features that I decided to add are:
- Improved UI (posters are displayed, search results are paged according to OMDB's API)

Feel free to check-out my last attempt I made in Summer 2020 at [https://armiantos.github.io/shopify-frontend-summer-intern/](https://armiantos.github.io/shopify-frontend-summer-intern/).

Most notable improvements are:
- No longer using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) (I'm now using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because I wanted to diversify my front end frameworks/libraries)

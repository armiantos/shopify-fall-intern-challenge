# Shopify Fall 2021 Front-end Internship Challenge

The Shoppies is Shopify's annual movie award. Each person can nominate for 5 movies. The movies are taken from OMDB. The 5 movies have to be unique. 

Feel free to check-out my last attempt I made in Summer 2020 at [https://armiantos.github.io/shopify-frontend-summer-intern/](https://armiantos.github.io/shopify-frontend-summer-intern/).

The difference between this and my last attempt was:
- I am now using Tailwind CSS instead of MaterialUI because I wanted to learn a new front-end library/framework
- I chose to not use Redux to simplify the code (and hence I also did not have persistence)
- I updated the UI to something more appealing and made it responsive (especially to smaller devices)
- Made sure everything was 100% accessible through the keyboard
- Did not set-up Github Actions for this repository
